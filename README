I needed to get the authbind utility, available from:

up and running on a Mac OSX box (specifically, Mac OSX 10.7 Lion).  I made
a few changes to the source code; most of the changes are in the Makefile.

Here's the list of changes I made, and why:

  PRELOAD_VAR defined to "DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES", rather than to "LD_PRELOAD"

  Added setting of DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE env var, as per dyld(1) man
  page recommendation.

  Added more logging to stderr of errors found in libauthbind, and the helper.
